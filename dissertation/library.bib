abstract = {High ozone (O 3) concentrations are a major concern about air quality in the S{\~{a}}o Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA). During 2016, the 8-hour state standard of 140 Âµg m-3 was exceeded on 32 days, whereas the 1-hour national standard of 160 Âµg m-3 was exceeded on 76 days. Exposure to such unhealthy O 3 levels and other pollutants can lead to respiratory disease. The focus of this study is to determine the main O 3 precursor in terms of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in order to provide a scientific basis for controlling this pollutant. In this work, 66 samples of hydrocarbons, 62 of aldehydes and 42 of ethanol were taken during the period from September 2011 to August 2012 from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. The OZIPR trajectory model and SAPRC atmospheric chemical mechanism were used to determine the major O 3 precursors. During the studied period, aldehydes represented 35.3{\%} of the VOCs, followed by ethanol (22.6{\%}), aromatic compounds (15.7{\%}), alkanes (13.5{\%}), ketones (6.8{\%}), alkenes (6.0{\%}) and alkadienes (less than 0.1{\%}). Considering the concentration of VOCs and their typical reactivity, the simulation results showed that acetaldehyde contributed 61.2{\%} of the O 3 formation. The total aldehydes contributed 74{\%}, followed by aromatics (14.5{\%}), alkenes (10.2{\%}), alkanes (1.3{\%}) and alkadienes (e.g., isoprene; 0.03{\%}). Simulation results for the SPMA showed that the most effective alternative for limiting the O 3 levels was reducing the VOC emissions, mainly the aldehydes.},

@article{Baker2015,
abstract = {Abstract. Policies to control air quality focus on mitigating emissions of aerosols and their precursors, and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). On a local scale, these policies will have beneficial impacts on health and crop yields, by reducing particulate matter (PM) and surface ozone concentrations; however, the climate impacts of reducing emissions of SLCPs are less straightforward to predict. In this paper we consider a set of idealized, extreme mitigation strategies, in which the total anthropogenic emissions of individual SLCP emissions species are removed. This provides an upper bound on the potential climate impacts of such air quality strategies. We focus on evaluating the climate responses to changes in anthropogenic emissions of aerosol precursor species: black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). We perform climate integrations with four fully coupled atmosphereâocean global climate models (AOGCMs), and examine the effects on global and regional climate of removing the total land-based anthropogenic emissions of each of the three aerosol precursor species. We find that the SO2 emissions reductions lead to the strongest response, with all models showing an increase in surface temperature focussed in the Northern Hemisphere mid and (especially) high latitudes, and showing a corresponding increase in global mean precipitation. Changes in precipitation patterns are driven mostly by a northward shift in the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone), consistent with the hemispherically asymmetric warming pattern driven by the emissions changes. The BC and OC emissions reductions give a much weaker response, and there is some disagreement between models in the sign of the climate responses to these perturbations. These differences between models are due largely to natural variability in sea-ice extent, circulation patterns and cloud changes. This large natural variability component to the signal when the ocean circulation and sea-ice are free-running means that the BC and OC mitigation measures do not necessarily lead to a discernible climate response.},

Here we present a bias correction method that corrects the mean error in the GCM, but retains the six-hourly weather, longer-period climate-variability and climate change from the GCM. We utilize six different bias correction experiments; each correcting different bias components. The impact of the full bias correction and the individual components are examined in relation to tropical cyclones, precipitation and temperature. We show that correcting of all boundary data provides the greatest improvement.},

The dataset contains all the variables needed for the initial and boundary conditions for simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF; Skamarock et al. 2008) or the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS; Ringler et al. 2008, Thuburn et al. 2009, and Skamarock et al. 2012), provided in the Intermediate File Format specific to WRF and MPAS. The data are interpolated to 26 pressure levels, have a horizontal resolution of approximately 1ï¿½, and are provided in files at six hourly intervals. The variables have been bias corrected using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim; Simmons et al. 2006 and Dee et al. 2011) fields for 1981-2005, following the method in Bruyï¿½re et al.

abstract = {Natural scientists and environmental organizations predict catastrophe if global warming continues at the current pace. Their indicators warn us about different hazards of climate change but fail to show their overall impact on human needs and well being. Environmental economists model future costs and benefits of economic activities to compare them with the expected damage and mitigation costs of climate change. The wide range of their estimates reflects different model assumptions and controversial pricing of non-market effects. We do not know, therefore, the significance of climate change, especially in comparison to other environmental and socioeconomic costs and benefits. Integrated environmental-economic accounts can reduce the ambiguity of modelling by measuring the economic costs of climate change during a past accounting period. Climate policy rather than politics could be the result.},

abstract = {Four sets of downscaling simulations based on the Eta Regional Climate Model forced by two global climate models, the HadGEM2-ES and the MIROC5, and two RCP scenariosâ8.5 and 4.5, have been carried out. The objective of this work is to assess the climate change over South America based on the Eta simulations. The future changes are shown in timeslices of 30 years: 2011-2040; 2041-2070 and 2071-2100. The climate change response of the Eta simulations nested in HadGEM2-ES is larger than the Eta nested in MIROC5. Major warming area is located in the central part of Brazil. In austral summer, the reduction of precipitation in the central part and the increase in the southeastern part of the continent are common changes in these simulations, while the EtaHadGEM2-ES intensifies the decrease of precipitation in central Brazil, the Eta-MIROC5 expands the area of increase of precipitation in southern Brazil toward the end of the century. In austral winter, precipitation decrease is found in the northern part of South America and in most of Central America, whereas the reduction in southeastern South America is limited to near coastal region. The time series of temperatures show that warming trends are larger in the Eta-HadGEM2-ES than in the Eta-MIROC5 simulations. Heavier precipitation rates are projected in the Central-South of Brazil toward the end of the century. Increase in the length of consecutive dry days (CDD) in Northeast of Brazil and the decrease of consecutive wet days (CWD) in the Amazon region are common features in these simulations.},

@article{Dominutti2016,
abstract = {S{\~{a}}o Paulo Megacity (MASP), with more than 20 million inhabitants, is among the world's most populous cities. Brazil is the only area in the world where fuel with a high ethanol content has been used since 1975 and its usage have increased in the last decade with the development of flex-fuel vehicles. Here, the biofuel effect on VOCs burden and composition it is discussed by a crossed analysis of long-term ambient data and emission data over the last decades in MASP. The most abundant NMHCs in ppb v were propane (5.02 Â± 5.94), ethylene (3.97 Â± 4.55), ethane (2.28 Â± 1.89), acetylene (1.98 Â± 2.11), 2,2,4-trymethylpentane (2.05 Â± 1.48), i-propylbenzene (1.96 Â± 1.85), n-butane (1.97 Â± 2.24), toluene (1.62 Â± 2.02), i-pentane (1.30 Â± 1.61) and propylene (1.26 Â± 1.54). The comparison with studies performed in MASP over the last 15 years showed a decrease in the NMHC concentration levels, in spite of the growth of the vehicular fleet and fuel consumption. Nevertheless, NMHCs mean concentrations were higher in MASP compared to those in other megacities worldwide (Beijing, London, Los Angeles and Paris) by a factor of 1.1 to 10, although showing similar composition. This suggests that NMHC distribution is dominated by traffic emissions regardless of regional characteristics like fuel usage and composition. Diurnal profiles of NMHC in MASP confirm these findings by all showing the same patterns as CO and acetylene, both recognized as combustion emission tracers. Finally large-scale ethanol usage would not affect the distribution of NMHCs in MASP and gasoline vehicular emissions seem to be the most important source of hydrocarbons in urban areas.},

@article{Esteve2015,
abstract = {Different types of land use have different physical properties which can change the radiation and energy balances and hence vertical fluxes of moisture, heat and momentum which also lead to changes in temperature and moisture felds near the surface. Simulating atmospheric ows over complex terrain is still a challenge, because the grid spacing in models must be reduced to better represent the topography, and increasing the resolution below 1 km implies to improve the land use land database at the same resolution. For this reason, in this work we adapted Corine Land Cover (CLC) land use database to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using a reclassify methodology. We compare changes in the most in uenced meteorological variables and we test them in a zone of complex topography. Likewise, the simulated values for the adapted CLC and the default dataset, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), have been compared with observational data in the Pyrenees valley of 'La Cerdanya' during a 9 day period in the 2013 summer. Physical interpretation of the results have been done using parameters such as thermal inertia or soil moisture availability showing the importance of land use and topography resolution in mesoscale meteorological modelling. In addition, statistical validation has been done to test the performance of the model with the new land use database. In general, results show that using CLC we achieved a better model performance in all the different simulations.},

@article{Gao2019,
abstract = {Future climate change can impact ozone concentrations by changing regional meteorological factors related to ozone (O3) pollution. To better understand the variations of meteorological factors and their effects on O3 formation processes under future climate conditions, we model the present and the future meteorology and air quality in summer over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region by using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry module (WRF/Chem), which is driven by the outputs of Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). The simulations predict that solar radiation, 2-m air temperature, and wind speed increase in the daytime over most of the YRD region. Absolute humidity and precipitation increase in the north and decrease in the south, while the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) has an opposite change pattern displaying a decrease in the north and an increase in the south. The southerly wind will be strengthened in the daytime. At night, the change patterns of the meteorological factors are similar to the daytime but with small variations. Meanwhile, O3 and its precursors all increase in the north and decrease in the south. The increases of NOx, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and CO are related with the decreases of PBLH and the input effect of stronger southerly wind, while the decreases are attributed to the output effect of the stronger southerly wind. During the daytime, the increase of surface O3 in the north is dominated by the chemical processes related with the increases of solar radiation, air temperature, and O3 precursors. The decrease of surface O3 in the south is mainly caused by the transport process changing with the strengthened southerly wind. At night, the surface O3 changing the amplitude is less than the daytime. The less O3 variations at night can be attributed to an O3 titration reaction with NO, the changes in NOx concentrations, and the increases of nocturnal PBLH. With the aid of H2O2/HNO3, O3 formation in the YRD region is found to be easily affected by NOx in the future. The findings can help to understand the changing trend of O3 in the YRD region and can propose reasonable pollution control policies.},

abstract = {The WRF-Chem (Weather and Research Forecast with Chemistry Model) has been used to simulate the formation and transport of ozone and particulate matter in the Metropolitan Area of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (MASP), Brazil. The simulations are being considered as a tool to understand the transport of the pollutants from the urban area to the surroundings and the contribution of remote sources to the air quality of the city. The objective of this research was to assess the impacts of using time dependent chemical boundary conditions (CBC) on the simulation of ground-level ozone concentration and ozone vertical structure over the MASP. The CBC came from MOZART-4 chemistry transport model and was assimilated to WRF-Chem using the mozbc tool. Two simulations were carried out with CBMZ chemistry mechanism, the first one was set-up to run with an idealized profile (default case), and the second one enabling the new CBC from MOZART-4, making any variation on tropospheric ozone representation be caused by the modification of CBC. The period of study was from 15 - 18 May, from 30 October to 1 November of 2006 and from 29 October to 4 November of 2013, when ozonesondes were launched and surface concentrations measurements of pollutants were performed. The simulations were compared with observations from air quality stations located in the city and with the ozonesondes profiles. The results showed that the main differences between simulations are located in the domain boundaries, with the difference decreased during downwind transport. In the MASP southern and western boundaries were the most important. Also, there was an improvement in the representation of ozone vertical profiles over 3 km, which means that in lower levels the local emissions presented more influence than CBC. Using MOZART-4 boundary conditions resulted in lower surface ozone concentrations than simulated values using the default CBC, it decreased the mean bias and in some cases increased the correlation values.},

@article{Guenther1994,
abstract = {Volatile organic compound (VOC) emission rate factors are estimated for 49 tree genera based on a review of foliar emission rate measurements. Foliar VOC emissions are grouped into three categories: isoprene, monoterpenes and other VOCs. Typical emission rates at a leaf temperature of 30Â°C and a light intensity of 1000 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1 range from {\textless}0.1 to 70 $\mu$g C g-1 h-1 for isoprene, {\textless}0.1 to 3 $\mu$g C g-1 h-1 for monoterpenes, and {\textless} 0.5 to 5 $\mu$g C g-1 h-1 for other VOCs. Isoprene emission factors are given for biogenic emission models that incorporate canopy shading effects and thus require leaf-level emission rates and for emission models that do not include a canopy model and therefore require branch-level isoprene emission factors which already account for some shading. Landscape-level emission rates are estimated by combining emission rate factors determined for tree genera with species composition and foliar mass data. Landscape emission rate factors are determined for each of the 91 woodland landscapes in the high resolution (1.1 km) gridded land-cover database compiled by the EROS Data Center (EDC) from satellite and ancillary data. This database covers the entire contiguous United States of America. Landscape emission rates are also be determined using gridded tree distribution data, based on aerial photographs and ground measurements, such as that available in the U.S. Forest Service (USES) Easlwide Forest Inventory Database (EFID). Emission rates are reported for 41 of the 65 tree genera in the EFID including all of the most common genera. Total VOC emission rate factors for the 91 EDC woodland-cover types range from 0.8 to 11 mg C m-2h-1 at a standard condition of 30Â°C and 1000 $\mu$mol m-2s-1. These landscape factors are based on branch-level emission factors and thus already incorporate canopy shading effects. The estimated fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes are in relatively good agreement with field measurements of area-averaged fluxes if accurate species composition data (e.g. from the EFID) are available. Total VOC emission rate estimates range from 0.8 to 4.3 mg C m-2h-1 for scrub woodlands and 2.2 to 11 mg C m-2h-1 for mixed deciduous/coniferous woodlands. The chemical composition of the VOC flux ranges from 8 to 91 isoprene, 1 to 56{\%} for monoterpenes and 8 to 73{\%} for other VOC. On an area-weighted basis, the U.S. average total VOC emission rate factor of 5.1 mg m-2h-1 for all woodlands is comprised of 58{\%} isoprene, 18{\%} monoterpenes and 24{\%} other VOC. In comparison to previous estimates, these emission rates are generally higher for isoprene and lower for monoterpenes. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Griffiths2020,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Poor air quality causes an estimated 2.6â4.4 million premature deaths per year1â3. Hazardous conditions form when meteorological components allow the accumulation of pollutants in the near-surface atmosphere4â8. Global-warming-driven changes to atmospheric circulation and the hydrological cycle9â13 are expected to alter the meteorological components that control pollutant build-up and dispersal5â8,14, but the magnitude, direction, geographic footprint and public health impact of this alteration remain unclear7,8. We used an air stagnation index and an ensemble of bias-corrected climate model simulations to quantify the response of stagnation occurrence and persistence to global warming. Our analysis projects increases in stagnation occurrence that cover 55{\%} of the current global population, with areas of increase aecting ten times more people than areas of decrease. By the late twenty-first century, robust increases of up to 40 days per year are projected throughout the majority of the tropics and subtropics, as well as within isolated mid-latitude regions. Potential impacts over India, Mexico and the western US are particularly acute owing to the intersection of large populations and increases in the persistence of stagnation events, including those of extreme duration. These results indicate that anthropogenic climate change is likely to alter the level of pollutant management required to meet future air quality targets.},

abstract = {Human activities are continuing to affect the Earth's energy budget by changing the emissions and resulting atmospheric concentrations of radiatively important gases and aerosols and by changing land surface properties. Previous assessments have already shown through multiple lines of evidence that the climate is changing across our planet, largely as a result of human activities. The most compelling evidence of climate change derives from observations of the atmosphere, land, oceans and cryosphere. Unequivocal evidence from in situ observations and ice core records shows that the atmospheric concentrations of important greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased over the last few centuries. {\{}1.2.2, 1.2.3{\}} The processes affecting climate can exhibit considerable natural variability. Even in the absence of external forcing, periodic and chaotic variations on a vast range of spatial and temporal scales are observed. Much of this variability can be represented by simple (e.g., unimodal or power law) distributions, but many components of the climate system also exhibit multiple states-for instance, the glacial-interglacial cycles and certain modes of internal variability such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Movement between states can occur as a result of natural variability, or in response to external forcing. The relationship among variability, forcing and response reveals the complexity of the dynamics of the climate system: the relationship between forcing and response for some parts of the system seems reasonably linear; in other cases this relationship is much more complex.},

@incollection{Krinner2013,
abstract = {This chapter assesses long-term projections of climate change for the end of the 21st century and beyond, where the forced signal depends on the scenario and is typically larger than the internal variability of the climate system. Changes are expressed with respect to a baseline period of 1986-2005, unless otherwise stated. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) presents an unprecedented level of information on which to base projections including new Earth System Models with a more complete representation of forcings, new Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios and more output available for analysis. The four RCP scenarios used in CMIP5 lead to a total radiative forcing (RF) at 2100 that spans a wider range than that estimated for the three Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios (B1, A1B, A2) used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), RCP2.6 being almost 2 W m-2 lower than SRES B1 by 2100. The magnitude of future aerosol forcing decreases more rapidly in RCP scenarios, reaching lower values than in SRES scenarios through the 21st century. Carbon dioxide (CO2) represents about 80 to 90{\%} of the total anthropogenic forcing in all RCP scenarios through the 21st century. The ensemble mean total effective RFs at 2100 for CMIP5 concentration-driven projections are 2.2, 3.8, 4.8 and 7.6 W m-2 for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 respectively, relative to about 1850, and are close to corresponding Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)-based estimates (2.4, 4.0, 5.2 and 8.0 W m-2).},

@article{Laurent2014,
abstract = {Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) are known to cause damages to human health via two main pathways, viz. the direct toxic effects exerted by certain substances (termed here human toxicity) and their indirect effects related to photochemical ozone formation (POF). To comprehensively assess the damages at national level and thus define adequate air pollution abatement policies, substance breakdowns are needed. However, these are not readily available as total NMVOC emissions are only reported at sector level. In this study, we developed a reproducible methodology that combines available speciation profiles, i.e. distributions of substances emitted per type of sources, and sectoral NMVOC information to reach country-specific, substance-specific emission profiles. Annual emission inventories, including 270 single substances and 52 unrefined groups of substances, were determined for 31 European countries within the period 2000-2010. Using life cycle impact assessment methods for POF and human toxicity, impacts on human health were quantified. The results indicated that a strong linear correlation exists between POF impacts and the total NMVOC emissions, suggesting that air pollution abatement policies could use total NMVOC emissions as a proxy for reducing these impacts. Despite underlying uncertainties, the results also demonstrated that the POF impacts from NMVOC are negligible compared to their direct toxic impacts. The analysis of the results revealed that the toxic impacts (i) are caused by few substances, such as formaldehyde, acrolein and furan, (ii) primarily stem from transportation sectors and from residential sources, and (iii) are found not to correlate with total NMVOC emissions. Our findings therefore suggest the need for supporting air pollution abatement strategies with comprehensive impact assessments, which, in addition to complementing emission- and concentration-based indicators, should allow identifying country-specific improvement potentials at substance and sector levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The concept of entropy and its relevant principles, mainly the principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), the effect of negative entropy flow (NEF) on the organization of atmospheric systems and the principle of the Second Law of thermodynamics, as well as their applications to atmospheric sciences, are reviewed. Some formulations of sub-grid processes such as diffusion parameterization schemes in computational geophysical fluid dynamics that can be improved based on full-irreversibility are also discussed, although they have not yet been systematically subjected to scrutiny from the perspective of the entropy budgets. A comparative investigation shows that the principle of MEP applies to the entropy production of macroscopic fluxes and determines the most probable state, that is, a system may choose a development meta-stable trajectory with a smaller production since entropy production behavior involves many specific dynamical and thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere and the extremal principles only provide a general insight into the overall configuration of the atmosphere. In contrast to the principle of MEP, the analysis of NEF is able to provide a new insight into the mechanism responsible for the evolution of a weather system as well as a new approach to predicting its track and intensity trend.},

abstract = {Ozone is a highly reactive, oxidative gas associated with adverse health outcome, including mortality and morbidity. Data from monitoring sites worldwide show levels of ozone often exceeding EU legislation threshold and the more restrictive WHO guidelines for the protection of human health. Well-established evidence has been produced for short-term effects, especially on respiratory and cardiovascular systems, associated to ozone exposure. Less conclusive is the evidence for long-term effects, reporting suggestive associations with respiratory mortality, new-onset asthma in children and increased respiratory symptom effects in asthmatics. The growing epidemiological evidence and the increasing availability of routinely collected data on air pollutant concentrations and health statistics allow to produce robust estimates in health impact assessment routine. Most recent estimates indicate that in 2013 in EU-28, 16,000 premature deaths, equivalent to 192,000 years of life lost, are attributable to ozone exposure. Italy shows very high health impact estimates among EU countries, reporting 3380 premature deaths and 61 years of life lost (per 100,000 inhabitants) attributable to ozone exposure.},

	abstract = {There is a consensus that particulate matter and gases pollutants originating from industry and vehicle emission processes in urban areas are important from the point of view of public health and climate change. Local anthropogenic emissions, especially those resulting from energy generation processes from the industrial and transport sector, are connected with those occurring at the regional and global scales. A major concern in the Metropolitan Area of S{\~a}o Paulo (MASP) is the impact of the large scale use of ethanol as a fuel and as an additive for Otto vehicles. In this study, atmospheric concentrations of ozone, nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were measured in the MASP in Brazil, over four seasons in 2012 and 2013. The results were compared with data collected in previous studies. Our results demonstrate that, although there was a large increase in the number of vehicles in the MASP that use ethanol (``flex-fuel'' vehicles), technological advances in vehicle emissions control have prevented any significant increase in the atmospheric concentrations of aldehydes. In addition, an increase in the formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio has been observed.},

@article{Orlando2010,
abstract = {Ozone represents the main atmospheric pollutant in the S{\~{a}}o Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA). In this region, its concentration exceeds the national air quality standards for several days out of the year. Ozone is a secondary pollutant and is a product of VOCs, NO x , and sunlight. Thus, it is very difficult to elaborate efficient strategies for its reduction. Computational simulations may provide an interesting alternative to evaluate the many factors that affect ozone formation. In this study, the trajectory model OZIPR was used together with the SAPRC chemical mechanism to determine the incremental reactivity scale for VOCs in the SPMA. VOC input data were obtained from two campaigns that were performed in the studied area in 2006. Values for CO, NO x , and meteorological parameters were obtained by automatic monitors. Five base-cases were created to verify the variation in maximum ozone concentration and thus determine the ozone formation potential of each VOC. NO x and VOC emissions were independently and simultaneously reduced by 5, 10, 20, and 30{\%} to verify variations in ozone formation. With the simulator output data, ozone isopleths charts were generated for the city of S{\~{a}}o Paulo. Analysis of the obtained results shows that the most frequent compounds found among the ten main ozone precursors in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, using the reactivity scales created from the five base-cases, were: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propene, isoprene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene, with formaldehyde being always the main ozone precursor compound. The simulations also show that an efficient strategy to decrease ozone concentrations in the SPMA would be to reduce total VOC emissions. The same strategy is not possible for NO x , as the reduction of these pollutants would increase ozone concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Oliveira2003,
	abstract = {The major topographic, mesoscale, and urban influences on the wind patterns of the City of S{\~a}o Paulo are characterized using one year of surface wind velocity data observed at 11 surface stations within its urban limits. The data was used to study the diurnal and annual variations of wind velocity and horizontal wind divergence within the city. Results showed that the circulation over the investigated area is dominated by three major factors: sea breeze; mountain-valley circulations; and urban effects, such as roughness, building-barrier, and urban heat island. The sea breeze was found to be the dominant feature of the monthly-averaged diurnal variation of S{\~a}o Paulo surface winds during the eight warmest months of the year. The sea breeze front induces a velocity minimum at the time of its passage and a post-frontal afternoon velocity maximum. Mountain-valley thermal effects on the flow can be seen in the temporal divergence/convergence patterns. These thermal effects tend to be more important during colder months, at night, and when the wind velocities are low. Nighttime downslope convergent flows are present over the city during winter and spring and daytime upslope divergent flows are present over the city during summer months.},

Speciated VOC emission inventory is fundamental for estimating Ozone Formation Potentials (OFPs) to identify key reactive VOC species and sources in order to formulate efficient O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} control strategies. With the use of the latest bulk VOC emission inventory and local source profiles, this study developed the PRD regional speciated Oxygenated Volatile Organic Compound (OVOC) and VOC emission inventories to identify the key emission-based and OFP-based VOC sources and species. Results showed that: (1) Methyl alcohol, acetone and ethyl acetate were the major constituents in the OVOC emissions from industrial solvents, household solvents, architectural paints and biogenic sources; (2) from the emission-based perspective, aromatics, alkanes, OVOCs and alkenes made up 39.2{\%}, 28.2{\%}, 15.9{\%} and 10.9{\%} of anthropogenic VOCs; (3) from the OFP-based perspective, aromatics and alkenes become predominant with contributions of 59.4{\%} and 25.8{\%} respectively; (4) ethene, m/p-xylene, toluene, 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene and other 24 high OFP-contributing species were the key reactive species that contributed to 52{\%} of anthropogenic emissions and up to 80{\%} of OFPs; and (5) industrial solvents, industrial process, gasoline vehicles and motorcycles were major emission sources of these key reactive species. Policy implications for O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} control strategy were discussed. The OFP cap was proposed to regulate VOC control policies in the PRD region due to its flexibility in reducing the overall OFP of VOC emission sources in practice.},

abstract = {A dynamical downscaling tool has been implemented to understand the impacts of global climate on citizens health. We have used the WRF-Chem mesoscale model (NOAA, USA) to produce information covering Europe with 25 km of spatial resolution and two nested domains with 5 km and 1 km of spatial resolution over London. Finally, detailed simulations are carried out using the MICROSYS-CFD model to take into account the effects of urban buildings on the urban atmosphere in the Kensington and Chelsea area. The tool produces very high spatial air quality and meteorological data (50 m) and also temporal resolution (1 h) to estimate health impacts in the short term, using exposure-response functions extracted from epidemiological studies. The comparison shows an acceptable agreement of the modelled data with the measurements. The effects on the health of citizens by temperature change in the future are more important than by changes in atmospheric pollutant concentrations. The maps show how the effects depend on the city's geometry and how the tool can highlight the most vulnerable areas to help to design plans and implement strategic measures to mitigate the effects of global climate change on people's health.},

abstract = {Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 is a scenario that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4.5 W m in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value. Simulated with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), RCP4.5 includes long-term, global emissions of greenhouse gases, short-lived species, and land-use-land-cover in a global economic framework. RCP4.5 was updated from earlier GCAM scenarios to incorporate historical emissions and land cover information common to the RCP process and follows a cost-minimizing pathway to reach the target radiative forcing. The imperative to limit emissions in order to reach this target drives changes in the energy system, including shifts to electricity, to lower emissions energy technologies and to the deployment of carbon capture and geologic storage technology. In addition, the RCP4.5 emissions price also applies to land use emissions; as a result, forest lands expand from their present day extent. The simulated future emissions and land use were downscaled from the regional simulation to a grid to facilitate transfer to climate models. While there are many alternative pathways to achieve a radiative forcing level of 4.5 W m, the application of the RCP4.5 provides a common platform for climate models to explore the climate system response to stabilizing the anthropogenic components of radiative forcing.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of vehicular emission factors change on tropospheric ozone formation in the Metropolitan Area of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (MASP), Brazil for 2004 and 2011. Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was used as the photochemical modeling tool. WRF-Chem was set up to run with four nested grid cells: 27, 9, 3 and 1 km. The Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM) version 2 was the chemical mechanism considered, turned it on barely in 3 and 1 km grid cells. The emission inventories were based on the estimated information of number of vehicles, emission factors and average driving kilometers for vehicle per day. The study periods September 06-09, 2004 and November 12-15, 2011 were chosen due to the high ozone concentrations observed, and the experimental data available for these periods. Observation of temperature, relative humidity, winds, and O3, CO and NOx concentrations from the air quality monitoring network of Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental do Estado de S{\~{a}}o Paulo (CETESB) were used to evaluate WRF-Chem simulations performance. The results showed that the chemical and physics configurations in WRF-Chem represented adequately the ozone formation cycles; however, with mismatches and maximum concentrations lower than observations, characteristics related with the estimative of the spatial and temporal distributions of the emissions as well as by the transportation of ozone and its precursors from external regions to MASP. On the other hand, given the characteristics of emission in 2004 and 2011, we found that MASP was under a strong COV-limited regime, principally in 2004. Finally, the scenario considering the emission factor of 2004 valid for 2011 in MASP showed a great impact in tropospheric ozone formation with high concentrations calculated for 2011 considering 1 km grid cell (with the most realistic vehicular activity), as result of a more efficient COV/NOx ratio calculation in terms of ozone formation.

abstract = {Abstract Smoke particles ejected into the atmosphere from biomass burning can modify the atmospheric composition around and even far from the sources. In late winter and early spring, biomass burning emissions from inland regions can be efficiently transported to urban areas in southâeastern South America, thus affecting air quality in those areas. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRFâChem) model was applied in order to investigate the impact of biomass burning sources on aerosol loadings and properties over the S{\~{a}}o Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA), in southâeastern Brazil, during the period from 19 August to 3 September 2014. The model performance was evaluated using available aerosol measurements from the Narrowing the Uncertainties on Aerosol and Climate Change in S{\~{a}}o Paulo State (NUANCEâSPS) project. The combined application of aerosol data and WRFâChem simulations made it possible to represent some of the most important aerosol properties, such as particle number concentration (PNC) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation, in addition to evaluation of the impact of biomass burning by analysing a fiveâday transport event, from 22 August to 26 August 2014. During this transport event, differences in the average predicted PM2.5 concentration reached 15 $\mu$g mâ3 (peaking at 20 $\mu$g mâ3 during the nightâtime hours) over the SPMA, compared with 35 $\mu$g mâ3 over inland areas northwest and north of the SPMA. Biomass burning accounted for up to 20 {\%} of the baseline PNCâ and CCNâweighted relative differences over the SPMA (2300 cmâ3 and 1400 cmâ3, respectively).},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the development process and main characteristics of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), a set of four new pathways developed for the climate modeling community as a basis for long-term and near-term modeling experiments. The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i. e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 Ã 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The RCP2.6 emission and concentration pathway is representative of the literature on mitigation scenarios aiming to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2 degrees C. These scenarios form the low end of the scenario literature in terms of emissions and radiative forcing. They often show negative emissions from energy use in the second half of the 21st century. The RCP2.6 scenario is shown to be technically feasible in the IMAGE integrated assessment modeling framework from a medium emission baseline scenario, assuming full participation of all countries. Cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases from 2010 to 2100 need to be reduced by 70{\%} compared to a baseline scenario, requiring substantial changes in energy use and emissions of non-CO2 gases. These measures (specifically the use of bio-energy and reforestation measures) also have clear consequences for global land use. Based on the RCP2.6 scenario, recommendations for further research on low emission scenarios have been formulated. These include the response of the climate system to a radiative forcing peak, the ability of society to achieve the required emission reduction rates given political and social inertia and the possibilities to further reduce emissions of non-CO2 gases.},

It is necessary to accurately estimate the magnitude and distribution of these emissions in order to reduce the uncertainty of local scale air quality modeling assessment. This paper provides a bottom-up approach by combining vehicle emission factors and vehicle activity data from a travel demand model estimated at the grid level to generate vehicle emissions data for the Beijing urban area in 2005. In that year, vehicular emissions of HC, CO and NOx were respectively 13.33×104, 100.02×104 and 7.55×104 tons. The grid-based emissions were also compared with the vehicular emission inventory developed by macro-scale approach. It shows this bottom-up approach can result in better estimates of the levels and spatial distribution of vehicle emissions than the macro-scale method that relies on more average and aggregated information.},

@article{Wei2019,
abstract = {As human encroachment increases in the Amazon rain forest, it is important to determine how anthropogenic emissions of reactive gases affect regional atmospheric chemistry. In the present study, we investigate the extent to which urban air plumes modify the levels of ozone (O 3 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ) in the downwind rain forest. The median mixing ratios of the background O 3 , NO X , and NO X oxidation products (NO Z ) were 20 (15 parts per billion on a volume basis, ppbv), 0.6 ppbv (0.6 ppbv), and 1.0 ppbv (0.5 ppbv) during the dry (wet) season at the study site. Compared to the background environment, air plumes from the city of Manaus had enhanced median mixing ratios for O 3 and NO Z by 30â50{\%} and 40â90{\%}, respectively. However, the enhancements of NO X in the air plumes were less than 20{\%}, indicating that the majority of NO X was chemically converted to O 3 and NO Z during transport. Results from a photochemical model showed that an injection of 8 ppbv of NO X into the rain forest can cause up to 260{\%} and 150{\%} increases in O 3 and hydroxyl radical (OH) levels compared to the background conditions, indicating the likely extent that NO X can modify the air quality and oxidative capacity in the Amazon rain forest. Slopes of the O 3 -temperature linear relationships increased with NO X levels from 3.7 to 6.5 ppbv per degree Kelvin during the dry season and 1.7â5.5 ppbv per degree Kelvin during the wet season. Average rates of change of the slope with respect to NO Z were approximately 1.8 and 2.3 times higher than those with respect to NO X for the dry and wet seasons. One key conclusion of this study is that NO Z substantially contributed to the O 3 formation in response to temperature under enhanced NO X conditions in the forested environment.},

abstract = {Projections of future atmospheric composition change and its impacts on air quality and climate depend heavily on chemistryâclimate models that allow us to investigate the effects of changing emissions and meteorology. These models are imperfect as they rely on our understanding of the chemical, physical and dynamical processes govern- ing atmospheric composition, on the approximations needed to represent these numerically, and on the limitations of the observations required to constrain them. Model intercompar- ison studies show substantial diversity in results that reflect underlying uncertainties, but little progress has been made in explaining the causes of this or in identifying the weak- nesses in process understanding or representation that could lead to improved models and to better scientific understand- ing. Global sensitivity analysis provides a valuable method of identifying and quantifying the main causes of diversity in current models. For the first time, we apply Gaussian process emulation with three independent global chemistry-transport models to quantify the sensitivity of ozone and hydroxyl radicals (OH) to important climate-relevant variables, poorly characterised processes and uncertain emissions. We show a clear sensitivity of tropospheric ozone to atmospheric humid- ity and precursor emissions which is similar for the models, but find large differences between models for methane life- time, highlighting substantial differences in the sensitivity of OH to primary and secondary production. This approach allows us to identify key areas where model improvements are required while providing valuable new insight into the pro- cesses driving tropospheric composition change.},

abstract = {Comprehensive model evaluation and comparison of two 3-D air quality modeling systems (i.e., the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF)/Polyphemus and WRF with chemistry and the Model of Aerosol Dynamics, Reaction, Ionization, and Dissolution (MADRID) (WRF/Chem-MADRID)) are conducted over Western Europe. Part 1 describes the background information for the model comparison and simulation design, the application of WRF for January and July 2001 over triple-nested domains in Western Europe at three horizontal grid resolutions: 0.5 degrees, 0.125 degrees, and 0.025 degrees, and the effect of aerosol/meteorology interactions on meteorological predictions. Nine simulated meteorological variables (i.e., downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes (SWDOWN and LWDOWN), outgoing longwave radiation flux (OLR), temperature at 2 m (T2), specific humidity at 2 m (Q2), relative humidity at 2 m (RH2), wind speed at 10 m (WS10), wind direction at 10 m (WD10), and precipitation (Precip)) are evaluated using available observations in terms of spatial distribution, domainwide daily and site-specific hourly variations, and domainwide performance statistics. The vertical profiles of temperature, dew points, and wind speed/direction are also evaluated using sounding data. WRF demonstrates its capability in capturing diurnal/seasonal variations and spatial gradients and vertical profiles of major meteorological variables. While the domainwide performance of LWDOWN, OLR, T2, Q2, and RH2 at all three grid resolutions is satisfactory overall, large positive or negative biases occur in SWDOWN, WS10, and Precip even at 0.125 degrees or 0.025 degrees in both months and in WD10 in January. In addition, discrepancies between simulations and observations exist in T2, Q2, WS10, and Precip at mountain/high altitude sites and large urban center sites in both months, in particular, during snow events or thunderstorms. These results indicate the model's difficulty in capturing meteorological variables in complex terrain and subgrid-scale meteorological phenomena, due to inaccuracies in model initialization parameterization (e. g., lack of soil temperature and moisture nudging), limitations in the physical parameterizations (e. g., shortwave radiation, cloud microphysics, cumulus parameterizations, and ice nucleation treatments) as well as limitations in surface heat and moisture budget parameterizations (e. g., snow-related processes, subgrid-scale surface roughness elements, and urban canopy/heat island treatments and CO2 domes). While the use of finer grid resolutions of 0.125 degrees and 0.025 degrees shows some improvements for WS10, WD10, Precip, and some mesoscale events (e. g., strong forced convection and heavy precipitation), it does not significantly improve the overall statistical performance for all meteorological variables except for Precip. The WRF/Chem simulations with and without aerosols show that aerosols lead to reduced net shortwave radiation fluxes, 2 m temperature, 10 m wind speed, planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, and precipitation and increase aerosol optical depth, cloud condensation nuclei, cloud optical depth, and cloud droplet number concentrations over most of the domain. These results indicate a need to further improve the model representations of the above parameterizations as well as aerosol-meteorology interactions at all scales.},

abstract = {Three-way catalyst (TWC) converter is one of the most important after-treatment device for modern light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs), which can efficiently control exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC) and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Nevertheless, a considerable part of in-use taxis in Beijing would operate with TWC purposely removed, which have been indicated by vehicular on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems. In light of high vehicle-use intensity for taxis, we recruited three China 4 non-TWC taxis and three China 4 normal taxis in a comparative experimental test by using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS). The results indicated that non-TWC taxis emitted significantly higher emissions of air pollutants than normal taxis with TWC functioning. For example, average emission factors of non-TWC vehicles were comparable to emission levels of China 1 LDGVs measured in previous studies. By contrast, emissions from normal China 4 taxis were all below China 4 emission limits. Furthermore, an operating mode binning method and a micro-trip approach have been employed to link vehicle emissions with driving conditions. For non-TWC taxis, we identified strong correlations of all pollutant categories between emission factors and average speed. However, such correlations for normal taxis were less strong, in particular for CO and THC emissions that were hardly sensitive to speed changes. This phenomenon indicates that the role of traffic conditions in affecting real-world emissions would become weaker when TWC can effectively mitigate emissions. This paper highlights the importance of in-use emission inspection to avoid any âhigh emittersâ that have violated regulation enforcement.},
